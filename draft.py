He scored 16,384,403\rvotes, his competitor, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei's representative in the Supreme National Security Council Said Jalili, received 13,538,179 votes. The turnout was 49.8%. Masoud Pezeshkian is 69 years old. He has been a member of the Majlis since 2008 - for 16 years he also held the position of vice speaker. He applied to participate in the 2021 presidential elections, but was not allowed. A heart surgeon, before his political career he headed the Tabriz University of Medical Sciences for five years.He entered politics in the early 2000s - from 2001 to 2005, he was Minister of Health under President Mohammad Khatami (1997-2005). Presidential elections have begun in Iran. What is important to know Politics rbc.groupIn Iran there is a conditional division into three political directions: fundamentalists who advocate a return to the ideology of the Islamic revolution of 1979; conservatives, whose ideas are similar to fundamentalist ones, but are more flexible; reformers who insist on transforming the system of governance (in particular, so that state affairs are led not by the supreme leader, but by republican institutions). Pezeshkian became the only candidate from the reformers.While the programs of other candidates are consistent with the policies of the previous president Ebrahim Raisi (died in May 2024 in a helicopter accident), Pezeshkian periodically criticizes the authorities, advocates for improving relations with the United States and women's freedom, including from wearing the hijab.rbc.groupВ The media recall the politician’s reaction to the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini - in 2022, she was detained by the morality police for not covering her head; she died three days after her arrest - according to the most common version, from beatings in the police station (the police insist that this was due to a heart attack). Pezeshkian called it unacceptable that “in the Islamic Republic a girl is arrested because of her hijab, and then her dead body is handed over to her relatives,” and demanded a transparent investigation.As nationwide protests began in the country, which were brutally suppressed by the police, he declared that “insulting the supreme leader will create nothing but anger and hatred in society.” “Pezeshkian’s position […] underscores the duality of the position of reformers within Iran’s Shiite theocracy - they seek change, but never a radical challenge to the system overseen by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,” notes The Associated Press. The new president will face serious challenges from day one, according to analysts at the International Crisis Group. “Social discontent, which has repeatedly erupted into protests, and an anemic economy are key domestic issues.In foreign policy, tensions with Israel and the United States, as well as the future of Iran’s nuclear program, take first place,” they note. In 2023, inflation in Iran reached 40% (in 2016, a year after the Iran nuclear deal was concluded and part of the sanctions was lifted, it amounted to 7.2%), and the purchasing power of the population decreased. “Prices of basic commodities such as dairy products, rice and meat have skyrocketed in recent months.The subsidized price of pita bread, the most popular product among Iranian households, has risen by at least 230% over the past three years, and red meat has become too expensive for many, with its price jumping 440% to $10 per kilogram,” notes Reuters. Speaking at In the second and final debate with Djalili, Pezeshkian said, “We live in a society where many are begging on the streets,” and promised that his administration would “immediately” begin working to lift sanctions and get the economy back on track.President in Iran - this is the second person in the state, a kind of prime minister who is in charge of governance; The strategy is determined by the supreme leader. The question of who would become the new president in this situation is not fundamental, says Nikita Smagin, an expert at the Russian International Affairs Council and the author of the telegram channel “Iran Duty.”And although Jalili, a person from the Supreme Leader’s entourage, is closer to Ayatollah Khamenei, Pezeshkian does not look like a politician who can change the rules of the game, and therefore he will not have serious disagreements with Khamenei, the analyst believes. He draws attention to the crisis of legitimacy that has emerged since the 2022 protests, which the arrival of a reformer will likely smooth over. Moreover, Ayatollah Khamenei is 85 years old, and Iran will soon undergo a political transition - in this context, it is important who will occupy significant positions. “The main difference between Pezeshkian and Jalili is that Pezeshkian is more in favor of dialogue with the West,” explained RBC expert.\xa0“He can try to establish this dialogue, start meeting with Western representatives.” Another thing is that Western countries are not eager to enter into contact with Tehran for a number of reasons: these are human rights in Iran, and its policy in the region, and relations with Israel, and cooperation with Russia. As for rapprochement with Moscow, here too nothing will change.“The parties understand that they need each other. And this tendency towards rapprochement is unlikely to be changed by anything. It's a similar story with the Iranian nuclear program - no change should be expected; Negotiations between Iran and the West have reached a dead end. Tehran's tactics are to develop its nuclear program to the point of creating a nuclear bomb as quickly as possible, if necessary, but not yet going down the path of creating one.

Ryabkov recalled the words of President Vladimir Putin at SPIEF 2023 that the doctrine is a “living instrument” and the authorities do not rule out changing it if necessary.Putin announced a lowering of the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons in the West, as well as the development of “ultra-low power explosive nuclear devices.”“We know that in expert circles in the West there are ideas that such weapons could be used and there is nothing particularly terrible about it,” he said on June 20.rbc.group Putin spoke about possible changes in Russia’s nuclear doctrine rbc.group policy The document “Fundamentals of State Policy in the Field of Nuclear Deterrence”, approved in 2020, sets out four conditions under which Russia could use nuclear weapons: the receipt of reliable information about the launch of ballistic missiles attacking the territory of the country or allies; the use of nuclear and other types of weapons of mass destruction in Russian territories; impact on critical Russian government or military installations; aggression against a country with the use of conventional weapons, when the very existence of the state is at risk. This is not the first time Ryabkov has spoken about a possible correction of the nuclear doctrine, linking this with “escalatory actions” by the United States and NATO, but he did not specify exactly what provisions may change.The head of the State Duma Defense Committee, Andrei Kartapolov, suggested that the time for making a decision on the use of nuclear weapons could be adjusted.

It was rejected because the United States also opposed it.At the same time, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon could deploy a new generation of ground and space systems to protect its satellite network, in particular by disabling enemy space objects. About how the so-called near space is used by different countries of the world in the military purposes and what means they use for confrontation in low-Earth orbits - in the RBC material. Which countries have the most satellites in orbit rbc.group According to the latest available information, by May 2023 there were 7,560 active satellites in low-Earth orbit, according to estimates by the American Union of Concerned Scientists ( Union of Concerned Scientists). The majority - 6.7 thousand satellites - are located in low Earth orbit. It also houses the majority of military satellites, but there is no exact data on their total number, since countries do not always disclose the capabilities of the launched vehicles, and in addition, commercial vehicles can also be used for military purposes.In the context of military space resources, analysts especially highlight China, Russia and the United States, which have both nuclear weapons and their own anti-space developments.rbc.group Since the beginning of the space age, that is, since October 4, 1957, when the USSR launched the first artificial Earth satellite , about 17 thousand satellites were sent into space, according to the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA). Since 1962, this organization has maintained a register of objects launched into space (in 1974, the General Assembly adopted a convention in this regard); Moreover, out of 17 thousand satellites, 15.5 thousand have UN registration. In 2022, UNOOSA received applications for registration of 2050 objects, in 2023 - 2250. According to the management’s calculations, about 100 thousand satellites will be launched into orbit in the next ten years. The key missions of military satellites are: intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR).Such satellites carry out either optical reconnaissance or radio engineering; strategic communication and navigation; early warning of missile attack. Types of orbits in which satellites are placed Low Earth orbit (LEO) are altitudes ranging from 100 to 2 thousand km. It operates ISR satellites that provide detailed images of the earth\'s surface and provide communications for military operations. The information obtained with their help is also useful in nuclear planning and guidance. Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) - range from 2 thousand to 24 thousand km. Its satellites are used mainly for navigation. They also help track targets and guide weapons for precision strikes. Some MEO vehicles are equipped with sensors to detect nuclear explosions. Geostationary orbit (GSO) is located above the Earth\'s equator at an altitude of 35,786 km, as a result, objects located in it appear motionless to an observer on Earth.It is the basis for early warning systems that, using infrared sensor systems, detect ballistic missile launches. For the same purposes, a high elliptical orbit (HEO) is used - it ranges from 600 to 40 thousand km. Among the first ISR satellites are the devices of the American Corona program (1950–1970s) and the Soviet Zenits (1960–1970s). 1990s). Such satellites collect information about the missile arsenals of a potential enemy and their locations, which made it possible and allows, among other things, to check the extent to which the United States and the USSR/Russia comply with bilateral disarmament treaties. Experts from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) note that the importance of ISR satellites has increased in recent years due to the development of precision weapons, the effectiveness of which depends on how detailed and timely information about the location of targets is.According to analysts, China and the United States have highly developed constellations of ISR satellites. Russia also attaches great importance to them, but has fewer of them; The development of this space sector was negatively affected by Western sanctions imposed in 2014. Borisov compared the loss of competencies in space with the destruction of a wonder of the world Politics Satellite navigation is used in both the civil and military spheres. China, Russia and the USA have their own original navigation systems. For commercial purposes, the American Global Positioning System (GPS), which has been in operation since 1978, is widely used. It began to be developed in the 1960s for military purposes - in particular, to improve the navigation of strategic submarines; Then the system began to be used together with ISR satellites for targeting high-precision weapons. China and Russia created their own satellite navigation systems in the 1990s. Beijing did this after the 1995–1996 Taiwan Strait crisis.Then the PRC conducted several training missile launches, but the missiles did not reach their targets; Chinese leaders said the reason was that the US had interfered with the use of the GPS system. In 2000, China launched the first BeiDou satellite; with its help, according to SIPRI experts, ballistic and cruise missiles are aimed at targets. Russia began developing its global navigation satellite system GLONASS back in the 1980s; It began operating in 1995, but its full use became possible due to funding problems in the 2000s. Commercial satellites located in LEO are also used for military purposes. For example, Starlink devices launched by SpaceX provide communications for the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The Russian Ministry of Defense stated that it could include these devices in the “list of targets for influence,” and in May 2024, The New York Times, citing the Ukrainian military, reported that Russia had deployed Starlink jamming systems, thereby increasing the number of failures in their operation.Experts point out that the use of commercial satellites for military needs is not regulated in any way and, in fact, is in a gray zone. The place of satellites in nuclear deterrence According to SIPRI, early warning systems located on GEO and VEO play a special role in nuclear deterrence. Their sensors are capable of detecting rocket engine plumes during launch, that is, informing about a possible nuclear attack. Since such systems allow increasing the time resource during which a decision on the necessary response can be made, they are especially important for Russia and the United States, which adhere to the concept of “launch after warning.”Data from these satellites is also important for missile defense - its effectiveness depends on how quickly missile launches can be detected so that they can be intercepted on approach. The United States, which has the most developed and large-scale satellite constellation, is the most transparent in its military space program. The American early warning system in space relies on the Defense Support Program (DSP), which has been in operation since the early 1970s. Over the past decades, the number of sensors on one satellite has reached 6 thousand, and its service life has increased to five years.The American command claims that DSP proved its effectiveness during Operation Desert Storm (the introduction of multinational coalition troops into Iraq and Kuwait annexed by it during the Gulf War in 1991), detecting the launch of Iraqi Scud ballistic missiles, a warning about which they received coalition forces in Israel and Saudi Arabia. Now DSP is gradually being replaced by the Space-Based Infrared System - SBIRS, which consists of six devices in geostationary orbit (they were gradually launched between 2011 and 2022) plus data from satellites in high elliptical orbit (including legacy DSP objects) and ground systems deployed around the world.Compared to DSP, SBIRS sensors are more sensitive and can detect relatively low-power thermal radiation. The United States is also developing a promising program operating in continuous infrared mode (Next-Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared - Next-Gen OPIR), which, according to the command, will provide “robust missile attack warning” and will provide “enhanced detection capabilities and exceptional resilience to counter hostile space-based threats.” Another system included in the missile attack warning perimeter, the Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor (HBTSS), will be capable of tracking the launch of hypersonic missiles.The Pentagon announced the launch of two such satellites in February 2024. While the American space warning system is focused on global coverage of the earth’s surface, the Soviet one concentrated on the Northern Hemisphere, notes the head of the Russian Strategic Nuclear Weapons project, Pavel Podvig. Like the United States, the USSR placed its systems in orbit in the early 1970s; by 2002, Russia\'s early warning system had become so outdated that questions arose as to whether it was reliable enough when it came to deciding whether to launch a nuclear attack. Over the past 20 years, Russia has been developing a single space-based Kupol system, which replaced the Oko and "Oko-1", operating in the 1980–1990s. The “Dome” system includes the “Tundra” satellites, traditionally called “Cosmos” for cover purposes. The first device of this system, Kosmos-2510, was launched in 2015. In 2020, Moscow announced that it had launched the fourth Tundra satellite, thereby bringing Kupol to its minimum staffing level.There were six launches in total, the first two vehicles operated for five years and were removed from orbit. Thus, today four of the ten envisaged satellites are in orbit. US authorities have expressed concern about dependence on SpaceX in space Technology and Media Podvig believes that four devices are enough. “They appear to have good observing capabilities and adequate coverage of everything north of the equator,” the expert said.\xa0“Since the satellites are deployed in highly elliptical orbits, they replace each other at the apogee (the point farthest from the Earth in low-Earth orbit. - RBC), so there is likely at least one satellite that can see the [rocket] launch.” The role of satellites in The Chinese early warning system is even less clear than the Russian one, SIPRI experts note; there is no official information about such Chinese systems or their development.The Pentagon, citing foreign media, said Beijing began developing three such space systems in 2013; According to the US command, in 2021 there was at least one Chinese satellite in orbit, responsible for warning of a missile attack. What methods of anti-satellite warfare exist? Satellites have a predictable trajectory and lack reliable means of protection, and this makes them relatively vulnerable. Therefore, many countries have been actively developing anti-space warfare systems in recent years. SIPRI analysts suggest that Russia and China are developing them out of concern that after the United States withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2002, their missile defense could undermine Russian and Chinese nuclear deterrent capabilities.“Counterspace defense capabilities can be used to counter existing U.S. ground-based missile defense systems by targeting early warning satellites on which these systems rely significantly,” explain institute analysts. Since the early 2000s, the UN General Assembly has annually adopted a resolution on preventing an arms race in space . However, there is no international agreement on this topic. From 2008 to this day, Russia and China have been trying to promote such a treaty at the UN, but so far without much success. Therefore, there is not even a recognized definition of what can be considered a space or anti-space weapon. In general, experts distinguish four categories of anti-space (anti-satellite) weapons. They can be used against a satellite or the ground station that supports it. These systems pose the following threats to orbital groups. Kinetic threats These are direct attacks with the physical destruction of an object.Here experts identify several subtypes of such systems. First of all, these are right ascension systems. These are typically medium to long range missiles that are launched from Earth to destroy an enemy satellite in orbit. The destruction of a satellite becomes known in real time. China tested such a weapon in 2007 when a medium-range ballistic missile was launched from a space center in Sichuan province and shot down an old Chinese weather satellite at an altitude of 865 km. In 2008, the United States launched an SM-3 interceptor missile from the cruiser to shoot down its de-orbiting reconnaissance satellite containing highly toxic rocket fuel. In 2019, India conducted a rocket test in which a satellite was destroyed. Prime Minister Narendra Modi called it an “unprecedented achievement” and declared the country a “major space power.”In 2021, Russia did the same, destroying the Soviet inactive radio intelligence satellite Tselina-D. At the same time, satellites of other countries, as far as is known from open data, have not yet been shot down by any state. In the same group are co-orbital anti-satellite systems - they are basically satellites that are launched into the same orbit as the target in order to destroy it. This could be a small space mine that follows the trajectory of an object and, upon approaching it, explodes, or a robotic “arm” placed on a satellite that removes an alien object from orbit.Rendezvous and docking operations must be as technologically verified as possible; and although international law does not include the minimum permissible distance between space objects and the requirement to notify other countries about approaching their satellites, such approach without warning will only increase escalation, according to SIPRI experts. In particular, American researchers consider the Russian satellite to be this type of weapon Kosmos-2519, which was launched in 2017 and from which Kosmos-2521 separated, from which, in turn, Kosmos-2523 separated. According to the American Arms Control Association, these facilities conducted high-speed maneuvers in orbit; The same thing was done by Kosmos-2542, launched in 2020, and Kosmos-2543, which separated from it (the “matryoshka satellites”), getting dangerously close to American military satellites.In general, SIPRI notes, the United States, Russia, and China have periodically carried out such experiments in recent years. Finally, this same group of threats includes attacks on satellite ground stations. We are talking about both direct attacks with conventional weapons (guided missiles, small arms) and undermining infrastructure (attacks on power grids, water supply lines or communication lines). The consequences are the loss of control over the satellites and the death of station personnel. Non-kinetic impact In this case, the satellite receives physical damage without a direct blow to it. Such attacks are more difficult to track, but equally difficult to assess their effectiveness. There are also several options for impact here. First of all, this is the impact of an electromagnetic pulse - we are talking about a pulse that arises as a result of a nuclear explosion in space. It acts indiscriminately, affecting all objects that are within reach. The explosion creates an environment with high levels of radiation, which also negatively affects satellites.The US and USSR carried out nuclear explosions in space before the partial nuclear test ban treaty was signed in 1963 (prohibiting explosions in the atmosphere, space and under water). The US studied how radiation belts in the Earth\'s magnetosphere (also known as Van belts) Allen) will respond to such an explosion as part of the Starfish Prime project. In 1962, the US military detonated a nuclear device 400 km above Johnston Atoll (North Pacific Ocean). There was no nuclear mushroom in airless space, but the electromagnetic pulse was so strong that on the Hawaiian island of Oahu, 1.3 thousand km from the epicenter of the explosion, a power surge occurred that disabled household electronics; Three satellites also failed, and the radioactive wave led to the degradation of the electronics of seven more space objects. Another option is the use of a high-power laser that can damage individual elements of the satellite - primarily optical systems (blinding attack) or solar panels.The laser can also make the satellite uncontrollable from Earth. In 2013, scientists from Changchun Polytechnic University (China), writing in Chinese Optics, reported that in 2005 they used a laser gun installed in Xinjiang province (western China) to blind a low-orbiting satellite at an altitude of 600 km. This experiment was mentioned by American expert Richard Fisher, speaking before Congress in 2017. The United States has repeatedly said that China has such anti-satellite weapons - for example, in 2023, Popular Mechanics magazine, citing the American government, wrote that at sites in Xinjiang there are at least two high-power lasers and that these objects show activity when foreign satellites are over Chinese territory.“The US government believes that China is trying to deprive it of enormous achievements in the field of satellite technology by damaging or even capturing military satellites in order to deprive the United States of access to them in a wartime situation,” the publication noted. Powerful microwave exposure also belongs to this group of influences from ultra-high frequency weapons (microwave weapons), which destroy satellite electronics. The attack could also render the satellite uncontrollable. In February 2024, the South China Morning Post reported that Chinese scientists from the Northwest Institute of Nuclear Technology in Xi\'an and the\xa0Institute of Electrical Engineering of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing have developed a super-powerful microwave emitter that can jam drones, military aircraft and even satellites.However, the researchers did not specify when the device could be used on the battlefield; according to them, the technology still needs to be improved. Electronic attacksThey are not aimed at damaging satellite elements, but at interfering with the operation of ground systems that transmit and receive data from satellites. There are two techniques here: jamming, which creates interference at radio frequencies, and spoofing, that is, generating a fake signal. Cyber \u200b\u200battacks are carried out to intercept data, damage it or replace it, or seize control of the system. In May 2024, The New York Times, citing an interview and public speeches by Pentagon officials, said that the United States could deploy a new generation of ground-based and space-based systems to protect its satellites—these systems, if necessary, could interfere with or disable enemy space assets.By this, the United States primarily means China, which has deployed “a number of space assets designed to attack our forces,” said Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall. “And we can’t operate successfully in the Western Pacific unless we defeat them,” he added. The problem is that the base of international treaties on space is very small. The key document in this area is the Treaty on Principles for the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, Including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies of 1967, which clearly prohibits the launching of weapons of mass destruction into space and states that the Moon and other celestial bodies can be used “exclusively for peaceful purposes.” “The creation of military bases, structures and fortifications on celestial bodies, the testing of any types of weapons and the conduct of military maneuvers are prohibited. The use of military personnel for scientific research or any other peaceful purposes is not prohibited.The use of any equipment or means necessary for the peaceful exploration of the Moon and other celestial bodies is also not prohibited,” says Art.
